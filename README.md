# Good Morning

I am a 15 year old game developer 
I have been only coding for a year now, and I do not do webdev, so projects are longer to make
My game engine of choice is the Godot engine and I hate Unreal Engine.  

My Goals for 2025
```
1. Learn OpenGL and create a small game engine / framework in it
2. Learn C and rust
3. Create a compiled programming language
4. Work on Carbon
```
