# Good Morning

\> I am a 15 year old game developer.  
\> Trans \:3  
\> I have been only coding for a year and 3/4 now.  
\> My game engine of choice is the [Godot engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) and am not going back to unity, and I do not like unreal engine at all.  

My Goals for 2025
```
1. Learn OpenGL and create a small game engine / framework in it (No progress)
2. Learn C and rust (WIP)
3. Create a compiled programming language (DONE - brainfuck# to C)
4. Work on Carbon (WIP)
```
